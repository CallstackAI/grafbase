A date-time string at UTC, such as 2007-12-03T10:15:30Z, is compliant with the date-time format outlined in section 5.6 of the RFC 3339
profile of the ISO 8601 standard for representation of dates and times using the Gregorian calendar.

This scalar is a description of an exact instant on the timeline such as the instant that a user account was created.

# Input Coercion

When expected as an input type, only RFC 3339 compliant date-time strings are accepted. All other input values raise a query error indicating an incorrect type.

# Result Coercion

Where an RFC 3339 compliant date-time string has a time-zone other than UTC, it is shifted to UTC.
For example, the date-time string 2016-01-01T14:10:20+01:00 is shifted to 2016-01-01T13:10:20Z.
